a a Chairs Business Website [HTML/CSS/JS]

A Friend of mine has a chairs business and wants me to create his website.

- RESPONSIVE THINKING, no pixel thinking [JUST clamp, min, max, vw, vh, em, rem, ch..]
- 1 SINGLE MEDIA QUERY for the CATALOG part, otherwise, I use clamp, min and max, calc, and flex-grow and shrink, I enjoy seeing the website getting responsive on its own, not be changing it for every single screen.
- started from scratch: UI.FIGMA then HTML5/CSS3 and Sass
- DOM Manipulation
