# CHER-DAK
a chairs business website

A Friend of mine who has a chairs business, and wants me to create his website.
Well, #Week1, I learned a lot
I learned so many things, mostly proud of:
- getting deeper into RESPONSIVE THINKING, no pixel thinking
- I used ONLY 1 SINGLE MEDIA QUERY for the CATALOG part, otherwise, I use clamp, min and max, calc, and flex-grow and shrink, I enjoy seeing the website getting responsive by its own, not me changing it for every single screen.
- started from scratch: UI.FIGMA then HTML5/CSS3 and Sass
- I really understood the benefit of js frameworks, since js code started getting messy in the end, well, I've just started learning React.JS with Redux
- divide the website into different pages, and use AJAX to fetch
- I learned to use JSON for small databases
- I learned to use clearNamesInVariables since the bigger the project gets, the harder it gets to maintain and remember 
P.S: we are still working on it, when it gets ready, We're planning to buy an A2 Hosting, I'll take care of everything, since
